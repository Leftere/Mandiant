Eye on Security,N/A,74,Low Sophistication Threat Actors Continue to Target OT,6/10/2021,Daniel Kappelman Zafra,,"On this episode we have Daniel Kappelman Zafra, a manager on Mandiant’s Cyber Physical Threat Intelligence team, to discuss a recent blog he and has team have released on the trend of lower sophistication threat actors targeting operational technology (OT). We discuss a precursor blog they put out last year, specific to this trend and the usage of ransomware by financially motivated actors to OT, and we talk about what Daniel is seeing change in this space. Our conversation touches on the various motivations that appear to be shaping this activity, and what it means for the potential proliferation of this as a tactic for hacktivists, opportunistic threat actors, and more. One of the things that I think really comes across in this episode is the thoughtful analysis that Daniel and his team apply to ascertaining the drivers of this trend and where it may be going. It’s an insightful look into an area of threat activity we will likely continue to see headlines around this year.

Eye on Security,N/A,73,How Mandiant is Helping Governments Build Cyber Capacity,5/19/2021,Paul Tumelty,,"Host Luke McNamara is joined by Paul Tumelty, Government Security Manager, to discuss how Mandiant is partnering with governments in EMEA to help foster cyber capacity building in nations across the region.

Paul walks through how governments are thinking about this, from the crafting of high-level strategies to working through the tasking of the appropriate entities for cyber defense, and establishing relationships with the private sector and beyond. Paul also highlights some of the challenges—and even advantages—that various nations may have depending on where they are in their journey of establishing a government framework to better address a changing threat landscape, especially in areas such as critical infrastructure protection.

What Luke found particularly interesting and exciting about the work Mandiant is doing in this space is the holistic approach Paul and his team are taking—beyond just ensuring the implementation of the right technologies—but looking at every aspect of what contributes to a nation’s strategy to continuously provide for a defense that can meet emerging threats. Luke and Paul even discussed the importance of early education initiatives to help foster the future workforce as part of capacity building.

 We reviewed the cyber events of the past year: pandemic-themed phishing, multiple APT campaigns against vaccine research and development, and ransomware targeting healthcare systems. Jens revealed that the biggest change still impacting the cyber threat landscape is the sheer volume of people working from home. He also highlighted the potential increase in the cyber criminal ecosystem due to job losses, and how individuals might turn to cybercrime in order to make money.

 Check out the episode now to hear how the pandemic has impacted APT activity and disinformation campaigns. Jens also shares a unique piece of advice on the threat landscape that is helpful to remember as we all work to better secure our environments.

The short answer is: a whole lot! Our host Luke McNamara asked Regina Elwell, Senior Principal Threat Analyst on the Advanced Practices Team, and Steve Stone, Senior Director for Advanced Practices, to take us behind the scenes so we can see exactly what goes into building an edition of M-Trends.

Steve started by discussing the sheer amount of data collection that is required, and how the team has to pore over this data—which comes directly from our incident response investigations—to determine what is a trend and what is not. Regina and Steve also touched on the evolution of the report from its first iteration in 2011. Not surprisingly, the reports have gotten more robust and include new data points almost every year.

We also discussed some of the highlights from our latest report, M-Trends 2021, and interpreted some of the key findings, including drops in median dwell time, increases in internal detections, impact of ransomware, and notable malware families from 2020. Additionally, we covered some of the process and approach Mandiant puts into grouping new threat groups (UNCs) and Steve and Regina’s favorite threat actors.

Eye on Security,N/A,69,"The ""Big Four"": Spotlight on Russia",4/12/2021,John Hultquist,,"We are wrapping up our “Big Four” series with a country that has been one to watch for quite some time: Russia. And who better to join me for this episode than our Vice President for Mandiant Threat
Intelligence, John Hultquist.

We started off this episode discussing how Russian cyber threat activity evolved to what we know today, from the days of Moonlight Maze and Agent.BTZ. We then shifted the conversation to some of the most notable Russian threat groups and the difficulties of assigning attribution at the organizational sponsorship level. While many APT groups from the “Big Four” may blend together various types of threat activity, Russia has utilized a particularly interesting mix of cyber espionage, information operations, and disruptive attacks over the years.

John brought up many notable Russian incidents, including: the Olympics, the Ukrainian power grid, the targeting of elections, and the SolarWinds supply chain breach. We also discussed some of the
challenges in communicating threat intelligence to both customers and wider audiences. To cap off the series, John delved into how organizations should think about not only Russian threat activity, but
the operations and campaigns from North Korea, Iran, and China.

Lloyd Brown, Principal Analyst for our Custom Intel Team, and Scott Henderson, Principal Analyst for our Cyber Espionage Team, joined our host, Luke McNamara to peel back the layers of China’s cyber capabilities.

Similar to past episodes in this series, we started at the beginning of China’s cyber operations—dating back to 2003. Scott and Lloyd took us through a detailed look at all the stages of China’s operations, including the shift in 2015/2016 from being “clumsy and noisy” to stealthy. Lloyd brings up a great point that’s worth hearing about their use of CVE exploits (which came into play with the recent Microsoft Exchange server exploits).
We also discussed how China’s cyber activity is driven by economic interests such as the Belt and Road initiative, the nature of their operations surrounding global elections, APT41’s cybercrime activity in addition to cyber espionage, and where they think China’s operations are headed. You’ll definitely want to stick around to the very end. Since our initial recording occurred before the Microsoft
Exchange exploits, Luke decided to follow up with Lloyd to get his take on HAFNIUM and the UNC groups we’re tracking related to that activity.

Eye on Security,N/A,67,An Inside Look into How Reddit Fights Cyber Threats,3/16/2021,Aylea Baldwin,,"How does Reddit handle malicious or suspicious coordinated activity on their platform? Our host Luke McNamara asked Aylea Baldwin, Threat Intelligence Lead at Reddit, to answer that question and more during this episode of Eye on Security.

During the discussion Aylea shared a few ways Reddit is unique compared to other social media networks—its tolerance for varying levels of behavior on different communities, the lack of user data collection, and the way posts are amplified through voting. The voting feature is unique to Reddit and Luke was curious to know how threat actors leverage it as part of their influence campaigns. As it turns out, the answer to that question isn’t so simple since foreign actors have to get buy-in from people to up-vote their posts. We ended our conversation with Aylea’s thoughts on the future of disinformation and deep fake technology, which is a concern in the security and many other industries, and something that can have a huge influence on sites such as Reddit.",https://www.buzzsprout.com/1762840/episodes/8377009,Podcast,No,"Threat Intelligence, Social Media ",Threat Intelligence,High Tech & Information Technology,"<div id=""buzzsprout-player-8377009""></div>

Eye on Security,N/A,66,Tackling Digital Safety for Women,3/8/2021,"Cris Kittner, Lillian Teng",,"Did you know that women are disproportionately affected by cybercrime, cyber stalking, cyber bullying, cyber harassment, and image-based sexual abuse? We asked Cris Kittner, Principal Analyst at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, and Lillian Teng, Director of Threat Investigations from Verizon Media to join us for a discussion around their recent talk on digital safety for women and practical strategies
women of all ages can take to increase their online safety.

Cris and Lillian provided their reasons and motivations for putting together the talk, which they first presented at the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2020. They highlighted the connection between physical and cyber stalking and the need for these conversations to be normalized. Far too often, Cris and Lillian heard from young professionals that they believed the cyber harassment that was happening to them in the workplace or at conferences was “normal.”

To combat the issues many women are facing online, Chris and Lillian provided a list of practical considerations that women should follow, such as using a password manager, knowing what permissions are being given to third-party applications, understanding that Snapchat images can be recovered, adjusting (or eliminating) location tags, and how to report abuse happening on social media sites.

We honed in on Iran for this one, and to help explore their cyber capabilities, we invited Sarah
Hawley, Principal Analyst for Mandiant Threat Intelligence, and Lee Foster, Senior Manager of Information Operations Analysis.

Sarah kicked off the episode by providing an overview of Iran’s past offensive cyber activity and how these capabilities have developed over the years. Lee shared how they have also grown their usage and willingness to use information operations (IO) and how his team approaches attribution and analysis of this disinformation activity.

We then touched on drivers of Iranian cyber threat and their apparent increasing willingness to target democratic processes. Sarah also discussed Iran’s destructive activity going after industrial targets
in the oil and gas sectors through password spraying and spear phishing operations.

As always, we closed out the episode with thoughts about what Sarah and Lee think we might see from Iran’s cyber operations in the coming years. Listen to hear their predictions and stay tuned for our upcoming episodes on China and Russia.
