While not every instance of zero-day exploitation can be attributed to a tracked group, we noted that a wider range of tracked actors appear to have gained access to these capabilities. Furthermore, we noted a significant increase over time in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups suspected to be customers of companies that supply offensive cyber capabilities, as well as an increase in zero-days used against targets in the Middle East, and\/or by groups with suspected ties to this region. Going forward, we are likely to see a greater variety of actors using zero-days, especially as private vendors continue feeding the demand for offensive cyber weapons.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EZero-Day Usage by Country and Group\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince late 2017, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence noted a significant increase in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups that are known or suspected to be customers of private companies that supply offensive cyber tools and services.

As a result, we expect that the number of adversaries demonstrating access to these kinds of vulnerabilities will almost certainly increase and will do so at a faster rate than the growth of their overall offensive cyber capabilities\u2014provided they have the ability and will to spend the necessary funds.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegister today\u0026nbsp;to hear FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence experts discuss the latest in \u003Ca adhocenable=\u0022false\u0022 href=\u0022https:\/\/www.brighttalk.com\/webcast\/7451\/392772\u0022\u003Evulnerability threats, trends and recommendations\u003C\/a\u003E in our upcoming April 30 webinar.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003ESourcing Note: Some vulnerabilities and zero-days were identified based on FireEye research, Mandiant breach investigation findings, and other technical collections.
