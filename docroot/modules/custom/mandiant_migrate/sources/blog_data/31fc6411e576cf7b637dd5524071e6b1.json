The past year has been unique, as we witnessed an unprecedented combination of global events. Business operations shifted in response to the worldwide pandemic and threat actors continued to escalate the sophistication and aggressiveness of their attacks, while in parallel leveraged unexpected global events to their advantage.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe discuss all of this and much more in the full report, which is \u003Ca adhocenable=\u0022false\u0022 href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/current-threats\/annual-threat-report\/mtrends.html\u0022\u003Eavailable for download today\u003C\/a\u003E. But first, here is a sneak preview of the most popular \u003Ci\u003EM-Trends\u003C\/i\u003E metric where we answer the critical question: Are organizations getting better at detecting attacks?\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, yes! Back in 2011, we reported a 416-day global median dwell time, indicating that attackers were operating undetected on a system or network for over a year on average. This time, from Oct. 1, 2019 through Sept. 30, 2020, the median dwell time has decreased to only 24 days. This means\u2014for the first time in \u003Ci\u003EM-Trends\u003C\/i\u003E history\u2014the median dwell time has dropped to under one month.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this drop in dwell time is promising, it is critical for organizations to remember that cyber adversaries typically only need a few days to achieve their objective, such as identifying and stealing the crown jewels of a victim organization or launching a crippling ransomware attack. Organizations across the globe must remain vigilant, to prepare for the next incident.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is much more to unpack in the \u003Ci\u003EM-Trends 2021 \u003C\/i\u003Ereport.
