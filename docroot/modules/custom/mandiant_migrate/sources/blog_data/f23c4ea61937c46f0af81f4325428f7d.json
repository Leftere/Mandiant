When organizations have a clear picture of the spectrum of threat actors, malware families, campaigns, and tactics that are most relevant to their organization, they can make more nuanced prioritization decisions when those threats are linked to exploitation of vulnerabilities. A lower risk vulnerability that is actively being exploited in the wild against your organization or similar organizations likely has a greater potential impact to you than a vulnerability with a higher rating that is not actively being exploited.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\/content\/dam\/fireeye-www\/blog\/images\/vulnintel\/Picture2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022type-XS\u0022\u003EFigure 2: Patch Prioritization Philosophy\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EIntegration of Vulnerability Intelligence in Internal Workflows\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on our experience assisting organizations globally with enacting intelligence-led security, we outline three use cases for integrating vulnerability intelligence into internal workflows.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\/content\/dam\/fireeye-www\/blog\/images\/vulnintel\/Picture3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022type-XS\u0022\u003EFigure 3: Integration of vulnerability intelligence into internal workflows\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETools and Use Cases for Operationalizing Vulnerability Intelligence\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E1. Automate Processes by Fusing Intelligence with Internal Data\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomation is valuable to security teams with limited resources.\u0026nbsp;Similar to\u0026nbsp;automated detecting and blocking of indicator data, vulnerability threat intelligence can be automated by merging data from internal vulnerability scans with threat intelligence (via systems like the Mandiant \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/solutions\/cyber-threat-intelligence\/threat-intelligence-subscriptions\/intelligence-api.html\u0022\u003EIntelligence API\u003C\/a\u003E) and\u0026nbsp;aggregated\u0026nbsp;into\u0026nbsp;a SIEM, Threat Intelligence Platform, and\/or ticketing system. This enhances visibility into various sources of both internal and external data with vulnerability intelligence providing risk ratings and indicating which\u0026nbsp;vulnerabilities\u0026nbsp;are being actively exploited. FireEye also offers a custom tool called FireEye Intelligence Vulnerability Explorer (\u201cFIVE\u201d), described in more detail below for quickly correlating vulnerabilities found in logs and scans with Mandiant ratings.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESecurity teams can similarly automate communication and workflow tracking processes using threat intelligence by defining rules for auto-generating tickets based on certain combinations of Mandiant risk and exploitation ratings; for example, internal\u0026nbsp;service-level-agreements (SLAs)\u0026nbsp;could state that \u2018high\u2019 risk vulnerabilities\u0026nbsp;that have an exploitation rating of \u2018available,\u2019 \u2018confirmed,\u2019 or \u2018wide\u2019 must be patched within a set number of\u0026nbsp;days. Of course,\u0026nbsp;the SLA will depend on the company\u2019s operational needs, the capability of the team that is advising the patch process, and executive buy-in to the SLA process.\u0026nbsp;Similarly, there may be an SLA defined for patching vulnerabilities that are of a certain age.\u0026nbsp;Threat intelligence tells us that adversaries continue to use older vulnerabilities as long as they remain effective. For example, as recently as January 2020, we observed a Chinese cyber espionage group use an exploit for CVE-2012-0158, a Microsoft Office stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability originally released in 2012, in malicious email attachments to target organizations in Southeast Asia.\u0026nbsp;Automating the\u0026nbsp;vulnerability-scan-to-vulnerability-intelligence correlation\u0026nbsp;process can\u0026nbsp;help bring this type of issue to light.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother potential use case employing automation would be incorporating vulnerability intelligence as security teams are testing updates or new hardware and software prior to introduction into the production environment.\u0026nbsp;This could\u0026nbsp;dramatically reduce the number of vulnerabilities\u0026nbsp;that need to be patched in production and help prioritize those\u0026nbsp;vulnerabilities\u0026nbsp;that need to be patched first based on your organization\u2019s unique threat profile and business operations.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E2. Communicating with Internal Stakeholders\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETeams can leverage vulnerability reporting to send internal messaging, such as flash-style notifications, to alert other teams when Mandiant rates a vulnerability known to impact your systems high or critical. These are the vulnerabilities that should take priority in patching and should be patched outside of the regular cycle.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EData-informed intelligence analysis may help convince stakeholders outside of the security organization the importance of patching quickly, even when this is inconvenient to business operations. Threat Intelligence can inform an organization\u2019s appropriate use of resources for security given the potential business impact of security incidents.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003E3. Threat Modeling\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganizations can leverage vulnerability threat intelligence to inform their threat modeling to gain insight into the most likely threats to their organization, and better prepare to address threats in the mid to long term. Knowledge of which adversaries pose the greatest threat to your organization, and then knowledge of which vulnerabilities those threat groups are exploiting in their operations, can enable your organization to build out security controls and monitoring based on those specific CVEs.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EExamples\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe following examples illustrate workflows supported by vulnerability threat intelligence to demonstrate how organizations can operationalize threat intelligence in their existing security teams to automate processes and increase efficiency given limited resources.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EExample 1: Using FIVE for Ad-hoc Vulnerability Prioritization\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FireEye Intelligence Vulnerability Explorer (\u201cFIVE\u201d) tool is available for customers \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/fireeye.market\/apps?query=five\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C\/a\u003E.

When a vulnerability is reported in the media, organizations often spin up resources to patch as quickly as possible. Leveraging threat intelligence in security processes help an organization discern when it is necessary to respond in an all-hands-on-deck manner.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake the case of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/cgi-bin\/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12650\u0022\u003ECVE-2019-12650\u003C\/a\u003E, originally disclosed on Sept. 25, 2019 with an NVD rating of \u201cHigh.\u201d Without further information, an organization relying on this score to determine prioritization may include this vulnerability in the same patch cycle along with numerous other vulnerabilities rated High or Critical.

Although the public NVD score rated this vulnerability high, Mandiant Intelligence rated it as \u201clow\u201d risk due to the high level of privileges needed to use it and lack of exploitation in the wild. Based on this assessment, organizations may decide that this vulnerability could be patched in the regular cycle and does not necessitate use of additional resources to patch out-of-band. When Mandiant ratings are automatically integrated into the patching ticket generation process, this can support efficient prioritization. Furthermore, an organization could use the analysis to issue an internal communication informing stakeholders of the reasoning behind lowering the prioritization.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EVulnerabilities: Managed\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause we have been closely monitoring vulnerability exploitation trends for years, we were\u0026nbsp;able to distinguish when attacker use of \u003Ca href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/blog\/threat-research\/2020\/04\/zero-day-exploitation-demonstrates-access-to-money-not-skill.html\u0022 adhocenable=\u0022false\u0022\u003Ezero-days\u003C\/a\u003E evolved from use by a select class\u0026nbsp;of highly skilled attackers, to becoming accessible to less skilled groups with enough money to burn.
