Paul also highlights some of the challenges\u2014and even advantages\u2014that various nations may have depending on where they are in their journey of establishing a government framework to better address a changing threat landscape, especially in areas such as critical infrastructure protection.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I found particularly interesting and exciting about the work Mandiant is doing in this space is the holistic approach Paul and his team are taking\u2014beyond just ensuring the implementation of the right technologies\u2014but looking at every aspect of what contributes to a nation\u2019s strategy to continuously provide for a defense that can meet emerging threats. We even discussed the importance of early education initiatives to help foster the future workforce as part of capacity building.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the episode now for all this and more.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\u0022buzzsprout-player-8548709\u0022\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\n\u003Cscript src=\u0022https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/1762840\/8548709-how-mandiant-is-helping-governments-build-cyber-capacity.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8548709\u0026player=small\u0022 type=\u0022text\/javascript\u0022 charset=\u0022utf-8\u0022\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
