        "text": "\u003Cp\u003EOn Jan. 22, FireEye participated in a panel focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology during the World Economic Forum. The panel addressed issues raised in a \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/content\/dam\/fireeye-www\/partners\/pdfs\/rpt-marsh-fireeye-crypto-paper.pdf\u0022\u003Ereport\u003C\/a\u003E developed by FireEye, together with our partner Marsh \u0026amp; McLennan (a global professional services firm) and Circle (a global crypto finance company). The report touched on some of the security considerations around crypto-assets \u2013 today and in the future, and in this blog post, we delve deeper into the security paradigms surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, some background that will provide context for this discussion.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ECryptocurrencies \u2013 A Primer\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBy its simplest definition, cryptocurrency is digital money that operates on its own decentralized transaction network. When defined holistically, many argue that cryptocurrencies and their distributed ledger (blockchain) technology is powerful enough to radically change the basic economic pillars of society and fundamentally alter the way our systems of trust, governance, trade, ownership, and business function. However, the technology is new, subject to change, and certain headwinds related to scalability and security still need to be navigated. It is safe to assume that the ecosystem we have today will evolve. Since the final ecosystem is yet to be determined, as new technology develops and grows in user adoption, the associated risk areas will continually shift \u2013 creating new cyber security paradigms for all network users to consider, whether you are an individual user of cryptocurrency, a miner, a service-provider (e.g., exchange, trading platform, or key custodian), a regulator, or a nation-state with vested political interest.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMalicious actors employ a wide variety of tactics to steal cryptocurrencies. These efforts can target users and their wallets, exchanges and\/or key custodial services, and underlying networks or protocols supporting cryptocurrencies. FireEye has observed successful attacks that steal from users and cryptocurrency exchanges over the past several years. And while less frequent, attacks targeting cryptocurrency networks and protocols have also been observed. We believe cryptocurrency exchanges and\/or key custodial services are, and will continue to be, attractive targets for malicious operations due to the potentially large profits, their often-lax physical and network security, and the lack of regulation and oversight.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis blog post will highlight some of the various risk areas to consider when developing and adopting cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWallet \u0026amp; Key Management\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EPublic and Private Keys\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two types of keys associated with each wallet: a public key and a private key. Each of these keys provides a different function, and it is the security of the private key that is paramount to securing cryptocurrency funds.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe private key is a randomly generated number used to \u003Ci\u003Esign transactions\u003C\/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003Espend\u003C\/i\u003E funds within a specific wallet, and the public key (which is derived from the private key) is used to generate a wallet address to which they can \u003Ci\u003Ereceive\u003C\/i\u003E funds.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\/content\/dam\/fireeye-www\/blog\/images\/CryptoBlockchain\/Crypto%20Figure1.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022type-XS\u0022\u003EFigure 1: Private key, public key, and address generation flow\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe private key must be kept secret at all times and, unfortunately, revealing it to third-parties (or allowing third-parties to manage and store private keys) increases convenience at the expense of security. In fact, some of the most high-profile exchange breaches have occurred in large part due to a lack of operational controls relating to the storage of private keys. Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of private keys requires fairly robust controls.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, from an individual user perspective, a large number of user-controlled software wallet solutions store the private and public keys in a wallet file on the user\u2019s hard drive that is located in a well-known directory, making it an ideal target for actors that aim to steal private keys. Easily available tools such as commercial keyloggers and remote access tools (RATs) can be used to steal funds by stealing (or making copies of) a user\u2019s wallet file. FireEye has observed myriad malware families, traditionally aimed at stealing banking credentials, incorporate the ability to target cryptocurrency wallets and online services. FireEye Intelligence subscribers may be familiar with this already, as we\u2019ve published about these malware families use in targeting cryptocurrency assets on our FireEye Intelligence Portal.

Several types of wallets exist, each with their own level of security (pros) and associated risks (cons). Generally, wallets fall into two categories: hot (online) and cold (offline).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EHot Wallets\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA wallet stored on a general computing device connected to the internet is often referred to as a \u201chot\u201d wallet. This type of storage presents the largest attack surface and is, consequently, the riskiest way to store private keys. Types of hot wallets typically include user-controlled and locally stored wallets (also referred to as desktop wallets), mobile wallets, and web wallets. If remote access on any hot wallet device occurs, the risk of theft greatly increases. As stated, many of these solutions store private keys in a well-known and\/or unencrypted location, which can make for an attractive target for bad actors. While many of these wallet types offer the user high levels of convenience, security is often the trade-off.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable border=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00220\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd width=\u0022138\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWallet Type\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd width=\u0022156\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EExamples\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd width=\u0022138\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesktop\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd width=\u0022156\u0022\u003E\u003Cul style=\u0022list-style-position: inside;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBitcoin Core\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAtomic\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EExodus\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EElectrum\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EJaxx\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd width=\u0022138\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd width=\u0022156\u0022\u003E\u003Cul style=\u0022list-style-position: inside;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBRD\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInfinito\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EJaxx\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAirbitz\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECopay\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFreewallet\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd width=\u0022138\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeb\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd width=\u0022156\u0022\u003E\u003Cul style=\u0022list-style-position: inside;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMyEtherWallet\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMetaMask\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECoinbase\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBTC Wallet\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBlockchain.info\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\n\u003C\/td\u003E\n\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/tbody\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022type-XS\u0022\u003ETable 1: Types of hot wallets\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf considering the use of hot wallet solutions, FireEye recommends some of the following ways to help mitigate risk:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cul style=\u0022list-style-position: inside;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUse two-factor authentication when available (as well as fingerprint authentication where applicable).\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUse strong passwords.\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEnsure that your private keys are stored encrypted (if possible).\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConsider using an alternative or secondary device to access funds (like a secondary mobile device or computer not generally used every day) and kept offline when not in use.\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003ECold Wallets\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOffline, also called cold wallets, are those that generate and store private keys offline on an air-gapped computer without network interfaces or connections to the outside internet. Cold wallets work by taking the unsigned transactions that occur online, transferring those transactions offline to be verified and signed, and then pushing the transactions back online to be broadcasted onto the Bitcoin network. Managing private keys in this way is considered to be more secure against threats such as hackers and malware.

Developers have identified \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures\u0022\u003E30 common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)\u003C\/a\u003E since at least 2010, many of which could have caused denial of service attacks on the network, exposure of user information, degradation of transaction integrity, or theft of funds.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most recent software bug was a \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/bitcoincore.org\/en\/2018\/09\/18\/release-0.16.3\/\u0022\u003Etransaction validation bug\u003C\/a\u003E that affected the consensus rules; essentially allowing miners to create transactions that weren\u2019t properly validated and contained an extra input \u2013 which could have ultimately been exploited to create an amount of bitcoin from nothing. This vulnerability went unnoticed for two years, and fortunately was responsibly disclosed.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERunning any peer-to-peer (P2P) or decentralized and distributed software is risky because each individual user has the responsibility to upgrade software when bugs are found. The more people who fail to update their software in a timely manner, the greater the chance of those nodes being exploited or used to attack the network.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EScaling \u0026amp; Attack Surface\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of this post, scaling blockchain networks to the size required to support a truly global payment system still presents a problem for the new technology and is an area of contention among developers and industry players. To address this, many developers are working on various scaling solutions. The following are some of the proposed solutions and the risks associated with each:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EOn-chain Scaling\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne proposed suggestion is to increase the block size, which consequently shifts the cost of scaling to miners and those who operate nodes. Some argue that this could introduce the risk of centralization, because the only larger organizations that can meet the bandwidth and storage demands of ever-increasing block sizes can support this type of solution.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EOff-chain Scaling\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the more popular blockchain scaling solutions for crypto-assets often depend on layering networks and system architectures on top of the base protocol \u2013 also referred to as \u201clayer two\u201d (L2) scaling. This allows users to conduct transactions \u201coff-chain\u201d and only occasionally synchronize them with the Bitcoin blockchain. Many argue that this is similar to how legal contracts are enforced; you don\u2019t need to go to court each time a legal contract is written, agreed upon, and executed. And this is something that already occurs frequently in Bitcoin, as the vast majority of transactions happen offline and off-chain within large exchanges\u2019 and merchant providers\u2019 cold storage solutions.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, two choices for off-chain scaling exist:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EOff-chain Private Databases\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis solution involves pushing transactions off-chain to a privately managed database where transaction can be settled and then occasionally synced with the Bitcoin blockchain. However, in creating this second layer of private \u201coff-chain\u201d transaction processing, an element of trust is introduced to the system, which unfortunately introduces risk. When transactions occur \u201coff-chain\u201d in a centralized private database, there is risk of improperly secured centralized ledgers that can be falsified or targeted for attack.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch5\u003EOff-chain Trustless Payment Channels\u003C\/h5\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother L2 solution would be to push transactions off-chain \u2013 not onto a private database, but to a trustless decentralized routing network. There are two primary L2 solutions being developed: The Liquid Network (for Bitcoin) and Raiden (for Ethereum).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a critique of this type of scaling solution is that the accounts used on this layer are considered hot wallets, which presents the largest attack surface. This makes it the riskiest way to store funds while also creating a valuable target for hackers. If an attacker is able to identify and access a user\u2019s L2 node and associated wallet, they could transmit all funds out of the user\u2019s wallet.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELightning and Raiden as scaling solutions are still relatively new and experimental, so it\u2019s unknown whether the they will be globally accepted as the preferred industry scaling solution. Additionally, because this layered development is still new and not widely implemented, at the time of this post there has not yet been an instance or proof of concept attack against L2 networks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ENetwork \u0026amp; Protocol Attacks\u003C\/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EActors may also attempt to directly exploit a cryptocurrency P2P network or cryptographic protocol to either steal cryptocurrency or disrupt a cryptocurrency network.

However, this method of mitigation falls short if an attacker impersonates a substantial fraction of the network nodes, rendering redundancy efforts moot. The suggested solution to avoiding Sybil attacks in P2P networks, as presented in the research, is to implement a logically centralized authority that can perform node identity\/verification.
