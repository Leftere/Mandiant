The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a \u0026quot;what if\u0026quot; discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk of losing much of our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating from China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat the threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in the public\u0027s understanding of the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe recognize that no one entity can understand the entire complex picture that many years of intense cyber espionage by a single group creates. We look forward to seeing the surge of data and conversations a report like this will likely generate.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDan McWhorter\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EManaging Director, Threat Intelligence\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C\/div\u003E\n",
