The impact of a successful ransomware event can be material to an organization - including the loss of access to data, systems, and operational outages. The potential downtime, coupled with unforeseen expenses for restoration, recovery, and implementation of new security processes and controls can be overwhelming. Ransomware has become an increasingly popular choice for attackers over the past few years, and it\u2019s easy to understand why given how simple it is to leverage in campaigns\u0026nbsp;\u2013 while offering a healthy financial return for attackers.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our latest report, \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\/content\/dam\/fireeye-www\/current-threats\/pdfs\/wp-ransomware-protection-and-containment-strategies.pdf\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ERansomware Protection and Containment Strategies: Practical Guidance for Endpoint Protection, Hardening, and Containment\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/i\u003E, we discuss steps organizations can proactively take to harden their environment to prevent the downstream impact of a ransomware event.
