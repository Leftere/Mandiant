According to Forrester, decision-makers now subscribe to an average of 7.5 commercial threat intelligence services (Forrester Wave: ETIS Q1 2021 and Forrester Analytics\u2019 Business Technographics) and threat intelligence reporting has become the most important SOC activity (Ponemon January 2021)\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, based on our own observations, rapid adoption of CTI often produces unsatisfactory experiences for many organizations, with common problems such as siloes of CTI coverage, poor identification of expired data, or inadequate intelligence requirements. In many cases, these challenges with application of CTI can be attributed to a combination of lack of staff and lack of skills to utilize CTI.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EMandiant\u2019s Commitment to Prepare Security Teams\u003C\/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn June 15, we took an important step forward in our commitment to prepare security teams of all sizes and announced \u003Ca adhocenable=\u0022false\u0022 href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/services\/training\/intel-wbt.html\u0022\u003EMandiant On-Demand Cyber Intelligence Training\u003C\/a\u003E.
