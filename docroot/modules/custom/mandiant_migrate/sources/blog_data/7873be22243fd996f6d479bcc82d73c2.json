        "text": "\u003Cp\u003ECyber security has evolved to become more than a compliance-driven mandate. Today\u2019s CEOs, boards of directors, and shareholders are demanding an understanding from IT leadership of the value security delivers to the business, which means that CIOs and CISOs need empiric evidence that demonstrates security controls are working as intended. In a nutshell, they need security validation to prove security effectiveness.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs shared in our white paper, \u003Ca href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/mandiant\/security-validation\/wp-security-validation-for-security-effectiveness.html\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003ESecurity Validation for Security Effectiveness: Five Critical Steps to Prove the Return on Security Investments\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E,\u003Cb\u003E \u003C\/b\u003Esecurity validation can help organizations meet critical business mandates and prove value to the C-Suite. Organizations that embrace and adopt the needed validation capabilities will be better able to defend against the rising tide of ransomware, data breaches, and other forms of malicious threats while they sustain, or even improve, operational performance and rationalize investments.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, did you know that:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E53% of organizations are unaware that an attack is active in their environment\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMore than 67% of attacks executed are not prevented\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERoughly 74% of the attacks tested in production environments go undetected\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOnly 9% of attacks detected are correlated by SIEMs and generate an alert\u003C\/li\u003E\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese findings, reported in the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/current-threats\/annual-threat-report\/security-effectiveness-report.html\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003EMandiant Security Effectiveness Report 2020\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E, were uncovered during testing by the \u003Ca href=\u0022\/content\/fireeye-www\/en_US\/mandiant\/security-validation.html\u0022\u003EMandiant Security Validation Platform\u003C\/a\u003E in enterprise production environments and compiled by the Mandiant Solutions research team.
