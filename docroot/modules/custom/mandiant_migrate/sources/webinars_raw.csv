2020 Mandiant Security Effectiveness Report Findings,"Join our webinar to understand why a majority of tested attacks successfully infiltrate enterprise environments without detection – and why security validation is so critical.

The Mandiant Security Effectiveness Report 2020 takes a deep dive look into cybersecurity performance across network, email, endpoint, and cloud-based security controls – and confirms the prevailing concern: security controls are not performing as expected. Alarmingly, thousands of tests performed by experts from the Mandiant Security Validation (previously known as Verodin) team show that for 53% of the environments tested, attacks were successful in bypassing controls without knowledge. This points to the need for continuous validation of security effectiveness based on four fundamental components.

Register for our upcoming webinar to learn about the fundamentals of security validation and gain the knowledge to answer questions such as:

- Do I have confidence in the effectiveness of my security controls?
- Can I quickly assess the relevance of threat intelligence or exposure to the latest attack?
- Am I stopping data leakage and protecting data integrity?
- How can I simplify and standardize my security stack?
- Do I have evidence to support communicating key metrics to executives?",5/19/2020,No,Matt Hartley## SVP Mandiant Strategy for FireEye Mandiant || Devon Goforth ##Sr Dir Security Instrumentation for FireEye Mandiant,https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10469/405971?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&utm_medium=web&utm_content=2020%20Mandiant%20Security%20Effectiveness%20Report%20Findings&utm_term=search-result-1&utm_campaign=webcasts-search-results-feed,No,,No,,,,Webinar,"Security Strategy, Security Validation", ,General,No,1

"Closing the Backdoor: Reverse Engineering SUNBURST
","At the end of 2020, FireEye revealed the details of a sophisticated threat actor that took advantage of SolarWinds’ Orion Platform to orchestrate a wide-scale supply chain attack and deploy a backdoor we call SUNBURST.

This attack impacted organizations worldwide, leading executives everywhere to question whether their environment fell victim. Discovering, sharing, and shutting down access to the SUNBURST backdoor, which allowed attackers to move freely and spy on victims, required the unique expertise of Mandiant’s Frontline Applied Research and Expertise (FLARE) team. And for Mandiant Managed Defense, the identification of victims started well before the public became aware of the SUNBURST campaign.

Join Mandiant experts for a retelling of the SUNBURST discovery story and a look inside how they addressed the SUNBURST threat with customers, including stories from the front lines of this customer-focused response. Our experts will also highlight:

How to Resolve the Cyber Skills Gap,"There is a very prevalent human factor to the success of cyber security; behind the technology lies a team of professionals with a range of technical and specialist skills used to implement defense and proactive hunting strategies. While technology has a big part to play in the war against cyber attacks, it is the human element which is both the catalyst for attack and defense.

There are an estimated 3.5 million unfilled cyber security positions forecasted for 2021 and research suggests it’s only getting worse. Security leaders must spend far too much time finding, hiring and retaining staff. When leaders cannot find appropriately skilled talent, they are often forced to hire junior employees. Less experienced and untested staff can dramatically increase the risk of a cyber breach.

The Security Operations Center is Essential – But Is it Effective?,"From COVID to the cloud and from ransomware to work-from-home, everything changed, fast. The foundation of it all – the Security Operations Center, or SOC, played a critical role in supporting how enterprises tackled the pivot in how we work, communicate and connect, while ensuring a strong security posture for the organization. The Ponemon Institute researched how these changes have impacted the effectiveness of the SOC in the “Second Annual Study on the Economics of Security Operations Centers: What is the True Cost for Effective Results?”

What stands out this year?

• COVID-19: The pandemic’s impact on how SOCs operate and tackle security challenges as remote employees create new access points and bad actors take advantage.
• Strong Hiring & Salaries: Jobs and salaries are up as CISOs drive to employ qualified security analysts and retain them in an environment where competition for their services is ruthless.
• ROI of the SOC is Dropping: Complexity, analyst turnover and the growing cost of MSSP support for security monitoring drives lower scores in SOC investment.
• Budgets include Automation & Extended Detection & Response: Extended Detection & Response (XDR) and security automation solutions have emerged as budgetary priorities as CISOs seek answers to improve security engineering effectiveness and cost.
