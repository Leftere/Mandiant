# This file contains your BLT configuration. For a list of all available
# properties with current values run `blt config:dump`. Default values come
# from vendor/acquia/blt/config/build.yml.
#
# These values can be overridden at the command line using `--define`, i.e.:
# blt setup --define project.profile.name=minimal
#
# However, when tokens in this file are expanded, they will not use any such
# command-line overrides. For instance, `blt sync --define drush.aliases.local`
# will not modify `drush.default_alias`, even though `drush.default_alias` is
# set to `drush.aliases.local` by default.
